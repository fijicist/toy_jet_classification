# Datasets directory 
This directory will contain the CMS2011AJets MOD Dataset which might be used in this classification task but right now we are using the quark and gluon jets dataset from energyflow which were generated by Pythia.

# Analysis Directory
1) import_dataset.py - This module is to import the CMS2011AJets Dataset and making it ready for input into the EEC module
2) graph_constructor.py - This module will construct the PyG graphs for particles in a jet from a dataset and save it to the graph_objects
3) ml_analysis.py - This module runs the ML classification task and the GCN model is also defined here.
4) metrics_plot - Contains the plot for losses, accuracies, and roc curve
